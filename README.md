# A Twitch Chat WLED Controller

Control a WLED using Twitch chat commands. This app currently supports setting the primary color of a WLED using the [WLED HTTP request API](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/HTTP-request-API).

Say `!color #RRGGBB` in the [dialogikTV Twitch livestream chat](https://www.twitch.tv/dialogikTV) to set the primary color. This commands only accepts the color value as a 6 character hexadecimal (`0-9` and `A-F`) string.
